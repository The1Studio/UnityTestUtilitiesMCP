  - `CoverageService` implementation using Unity Code Coverage API
- Conditional compilation support for optional Code Coverage package
- EditorPrefs persistence for coverage settings
- Automatic HTML report generation
- Comprehensive error handling and validation
- Unity Console logging with `[CoverageService]` prefix
- Support for Unity 2022.3+
- Dependency on Unity MCP 6.0.0+
- Dependency on Unity Test Framework 1.4.0+
- Optional integration with Code Coverage package 1.0.0+

### Testing
- Comprehensive unit test suite with 59 tests
- Test coverage for all services:
  - `CoverageServiceTests` (11 tests): Enable/disable, start/stop recording, EditorPrefs persistence
  - `TestFilterServiceTests` (12 tests): Mode filtering, category/assembly filtering, pattern matching
  - `TestResultsServiceTests` (10 tests): File location, XML parsing, failure detail extraction
- Test coverage for MCP tools:
  - `EnableCodeCoverageTests` (10 tests): Parameter handling, validation, conditional compilation
  - `RunFilteredTestsTests` (16 tests): Mode selection, filtering, regex patterns, error handling
- Test assembly definition with proper configuration
- Conditional tests for optional Code Coverage package
- Platform-specific test scenarios (Linux/Mac/Windows)

### Documentation
- Comprehensive README.md with installation and usage instructions
- Complete API reference documentation
- Detailed usage examples including:
  - Basic coverage workflows
  - Advanced multi-session coverage
  - CI/CD integration examples (GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitLab CI)
